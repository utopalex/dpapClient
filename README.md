dpapClient
==========

A simple DPAP client for iOS

This is a simple iOS client that connects to the now defunct iPhoto Image Sharing functionality that was implemented via DPAP.

To set on iPhoto:

1. On iPhoto, set up image sharing. Currently, password setting is not supported. It can be changed in AppSetting.m.

2. Start the app. If no firewall is disturbing it, the app should find your iPhoto share. You can then connect to it and browse the images.

Since iPhoto image sharing is now defunct, this project just offers a starting point if you need to connect to DMAP or DPAP.
